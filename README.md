# CG-challenge
Our attempt at the CG challenge for the geometric algorithms course at TU/e

The following packages must be installed to run our application:
- matplotlib
- numpy

To run the application use the command
For a normal run
	python partitioning.py <location/filename.json>
For a run where you see the sweepline algorithm (not recommended for large instances)
	python partitioning.py <location/filename.json> -v
