# CG-challenge
Our attempt at the CG challenge for the geometric algorithms course at TU/e

So far we have:
- a balanced binary serach tree implemented for the satus structures
- we can handle events and create new events
- create a status qeueue and update them


struggle #1
1+ lines can have the same start/end point so in the status queue its handled as only one line, which is incorrect
